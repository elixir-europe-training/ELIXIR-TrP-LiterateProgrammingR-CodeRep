## 5.1 Putting it all together

Now that you have been introduced to:

1. The importance of literate programming (LP)
2. Using markdown to narrate your code
3. Using Quarto to knit your code and narrative into a single LP-compliant document

It is time for a more comprehensive rounding-off exercise to bring it all together.


!!! question "Exercise"

    Return to our original example of [non-LP script](https://github.com/elixir-europe-training/ELIXIR-TrP-LiterateProgrammingR-CodeRep/blob/main/docs/scripts/analysis.R) and rework it into a full fledged literate programming 
    document by applying uour knowledge of markdown and quarto to transform the original script into an LP HTML or PDF document (Fig. 5.1).

    Specifically:
    
    1. Obtain the [analysis.R](https://github.com/elixir-europe-training/ELIXIR-TrP-LiterateProgrammingR-CodeRep/blob/main/docs/scripts/analysis.R) script, copy the script into a new empty script in your RStudio environment  
    2. Convert the script into a .Qmd or .Rmd document, with explanatory text and code chunks for plain code and plots
    3. Knit your final .Qmd or .Rmd file to a PDF (or HTML) document

        There are no right or wrong answers here but certain solutions will definitely be better than others. if you get stuck or need inspiration check out one possible solution [here](https://github.com/elixir-europe-training/ELIXIR-TrP-LiterateProgrammingR-CodeRep/blob/main/docs/scripts/wisconsin.Rmd)
