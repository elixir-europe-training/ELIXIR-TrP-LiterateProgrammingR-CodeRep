## 5.1 Concluding Remarks

Great job in making it to the end of this course?module? ! Along the way we hope you:

1. Developed an appreciation for the need and principles of Literate Programming (LP) in research
2. Acquired some new skills in Markdown and conducting LP using R/RStudio and Quarto

As with most technical skills, mastery requires practice, practice and more practise. We hope the lessons here have prepared you to adopt an LP approach for your next project!

For those who want a deeper dive or learn more about a specifc aspect of this course, below is a selection our favourite links on learning Literate Programming, Markdown, and LP with RStudio/Quarto.
Additionally, this course is the first part in a multi-series programme on implementing code reproducibility for research. Links and brief descriptions of further course in the series can be found further below.

## 5.2 Further Resources on Literate Programming with RStudio/Quarto
