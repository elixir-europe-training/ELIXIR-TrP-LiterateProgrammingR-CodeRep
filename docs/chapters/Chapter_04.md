## 4.1 What's Our Goal? üéØ

Welcome to the last chapter of this tutorial. 

In this chapter, we present you with a tool that can assist you in your work. Quarto integrates markdown writing with code execution for data formatting, analysis, and visualization‚Äîall in one place helping speed up the production of scientific reports, publications, and articles.

## 4.2 What is Quarto, and Why Does It Matter? üìñ

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is the next generation of R Markdown from Posit. It's a Pandoc-powered open-source publishing system that's designed to work with a variety of computer languages, including Python, R, and Julia. Quarto simplifies the entire R Markdown ecosystem, allowing you to publish documents, books, presentations, web pages, and more in the format you want (for example HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub). 

**Key Benefits of Quarto:**
- Offers a refined structure for document organization and layout
- Facilitates seamless coordination across various formats
- Enhanced capabilities for integrating multiple programming languages within a single project, such as R in knitr and Python/Julia in Jupyter
- Works effortlessly with RStudio Visual Editor, making the creation of HTML slides easy

In addition, it enables users to:
Write reproducible research reports, presentations, or scientific articles
- Design personal or project websites
- Craft tutorials, textbooks, and other online educational resources

  "rmarkdown",     # Essential for rendering
  "tidyverse",     # Useful for data wrangling
  "knitr",         # Required for table printing
  "kableExtra"     # Enhances table printing
))
```

## 4.5 Let's Dive In! üåä

### 4.5.1 The Quarto Workflow

Quarto operates on a two-step process to create documents. Here's how it works:

1. **Code Execution**: Your `.qmd` file is handed over to ![**knitr**](https://yihui.org/knitr/), which takes care of executing code chunks and generating a markdown (.md) document. This markdown file includes both code and its output.

2. **Final Rendering**: Next, ![**pandoc**](https://pandoc.org) steps in to process the markdown file, ultimately producing the final output. The beauty of this process is its flexibility‚Äîit supports a wide range of output formats.

*[Include a visual diagram of the Quarto workflow here]*

### 4.5.2 Understanding the Quarto Document

Instead of relying on plain scripts, we use Quarto files in RStudio to bring reproducibility into our workflow. Quarto files have the power to dynamically generate code and narratives for our documents. The key components of a Quarto document are:

1. **The YAML Header**: This acts as your document's backstage pass, influencing various rendering phases. It holds essential information that shapes your document's code, content, and presentation. The YAML header is placed at the beginning of your document and is carefully evaluated by Pandoc, Quarto, and knitr.

2. **Quarto-formatted Text**: Text in a Quarto document follows Markdown formatting rules. While regular text is fine for humans, **R scripts** need specific formatting to be interpreted as **code**. Quarto requires code to be enclosed in special characters and formatting symbols like `**##**`, `**\*\***`, and `**< >**` instead of standard grammar components.

3. **R Code Chunks**: Code blocks in a `.qmd` file are visually distinct with their gray background. Each code block is enclosed by three tick marks (`**'''**`). In source mode, the first three tick marks are followed by curly brackets containing additional code. These code blocks define the **R code** for tasks like generating summaries, conducting analyses, creating tables, and generating graphs. If you already have an R script, you can simply **copy and paste** it into the document, ensuring it adheres to the required formatting.

Quarto provides flexibility in coding by allowing you to use various languages within RStudio, including **R**, **Python**, **Bash**, and **SQL**.

**Example Code:**

```{r}
## ----read---------------------------------------------------------------------
cancer_data <- as_tibble(read.csv("data/breast-cancer-wisconsin.csv"))
head(cancer_data)
cancer_data$diagnosis <- as.factor(cancer_data$diagnosis)
colnames(cancer_data)
dim(cancer_data)
```

### 4.5.3 Creating Your First Quarto Document

*Figure A: A Quarto document in RStudio that combines code and results.*

Let's get started by creating a basic Quarto document:

#### 4.5.3.1 Starting a New Quarto Document 

In RStudio, follow these steps to begin:

1. Navigate to the menu bar and select **File > New File > Quarto Document...**.
2. RStudio will open a wizard to help you set up your document with essential content and configurations.

#### 4.5.3.2 YAML Header (Metadata)

The **YAML metadata**, or header, is absolutely essential in Quarto documents. This metadata acts as your document's backstage pass, influencing many rendering phases. It contains crucial information that shapes your document's code, content, and presentation. Placed at the beginning, the YAML header is carefully evaluated by Pandoc, Quarto, and knitr.

A default Quarto YAML header includes the following metadata surrounded by three dashes `---`:

- `title`
- `author`
- `format`
- `editor`

Here's an example YAML header:

```yaml
---
title: "Document title"
author: "Your Name"
execute:
  echo: false
format: html
---
```


### 4.5.4 Rendering Qmd Document

**Rendering** in Quarto is the process of converting your document from one format to another that supports pages or pagination. When you click render, your code will be compiled, verified for faults, and written to the YAML header file type. It also checks code for errors, so ensure your `.qmd` document is free of errors before proceeding.

To render your document:

1. Give your document a **name** and choose a **folder** for rendering.

   - Name your file `my_first_qmd.qmd`.
   - Save it to an accessible file system directory.

2. Click the **"Render"** button, usually located at the bottom of your interface (see the figure below).

**FIGURE:** [Insert an image or screenshot showing the "Render" button.]

## 4.5 Writing Quarto Documents

### RStudio Visual Editor: Simplified Formatting

The RStudio visual editor simplifies formatting, making it easier to create Quarto documents. To access the visual editor for your document, follow these steps:

1. **Activate Visual Mode**: Click the visual option at the top-left of the toolbar.

   This opens a formatting bar that resembles popular document editors like Google Docs.

2. **Switch Between Modes**: You can switch between source and visual modes at any time. This feature lets you retain your editing location and undo/redo your changes.

### *Writing text*

##### Adding Headings

To create headings, you can use a shortcut. For a list of editing shortcuts, refer to [this link](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/shortcuts.html).

_Example:_
```markdown
# Heading 1
This is a sentence with some **bold text**, some *italic text*, and an ![image](image.png).
```

### *Creating Bullet and Numbered Lists*

In Quarto, you can easily transform plain text into organized lists. Here's how:

**Bullet Lists:**
- To create a bullet list, simply start each item with an asterisk (*), a plus (+), or a hyphen (-), followed by a space.

 Example:
   ```markdown
   - Item 1
   - Item 2
   - Item 3
```
  Example:
   ```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```
### *Adding Images*
You can enhance your Quarto documents by adding images. The visual editor simplifies this process:

**Browse and Insert**: Click on the image icon in the formatting bar, browse your computer to find the image file, and insert it into your Qmd document.
Example
```
![Alt Text](image.png)
```
### *Adding Links*
In Quarto, adding links is straightforward:

1. **Link Icon**: Click on the link icon in the formatting bar.
2. **Paste URL**: Paste the web address (URL) in the URL field.

Example:
```markdown
[Link Text](https://www.example.com)
```

### *Creating tables* 
Quarto makes it easy to include tables in your documents:

1. **Insert Table**: To add a table, select the location in your document where you want the table to appear.
2. **Specify Rows and Columns**: Define the number of rows and columns you need for your table.

Example:
```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   |
| Data 3   | Data 4   |
```

### *Adding Formulas*
For mathematical content, you can incorporate formulas into your Quarto documents using LaTeX syntax. LaTeX is a widely-used typesetting system for scientific documents.


```markdown
$\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \binom{n}{k}$
```


## 5 Code in Quarto Documents 

Quarto does things a bit differently than standard code writing. Instead of starting with code, you begin by adding text. But how does Quarto know what's code and what's not, without using comments like #?

That's where **"Code Chunks"** come in handy. Think of them as the bridge between your words and the code's magic. Here's how it all works:

### What is Knitr? 

Knitr is a special tool inside RStudio that powers the dynamic part of Quarto reports. It allows you to smoothly mix R code into your Quarto documents, whether they end up as HTML, Word, PDF, or LaTeX files. Knitr is essential for a concept called **Literate Programming**, which helps make your work reproducible.

### Writing Code with Code Chunks üìù

#### Adding a Code Chunk

You have a few ways to insert a code chunk into your Quarto document:

- Use the **Insert > Code Chunk** option in the editor's toolbar.
- Manually type the code chunk's special markers: `{r}` and triple backticks (\```).
  *If you're in "editor" mode, remember to close the code chunk with triple backticks as well (\```).*
- Or just press the keyboard shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + I (Windows) or Cmd + Option + I (Mac).

üì∑ [Include a figure or screenshot showing how to add an R code chunk here]

Here are some common settings for code chunks:

- **include**: A yes/no choice to put the chunk's result in your document (it's usually yes).
- **eval**: A yes/no choice to run the code or not (yes is common), or you can specify which lines to run.
- **echo**: A yes/no choice to display the code (often yes).
- **results**: A yes/no choice to show the code's results in your document (yes is typical).
- **warning**: A yes/no choice to display warnings (often yes).
- **message**: A yes/no choice to show messages when running the code (often yes).

#### Label Your Code Chunk

Before we make our code look pretty when it runs, let's give it a name. This step isn't required for running code, but it helps if you want to do fancy things with your Qmd files later, like cross-referencing.

Here's what you need to know:

- The label format is simple: `#| label: chunk-label`.
- Each chunk must have a unique label.


### Bibliography 


# Let's Build a Quarto Paper/Document

Before we start, ensure you have downloaded [the data]([https://www.example.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)).

## Step 0: Create a YAML Header
Before we dive into the document's content, let's set up the YAML front matter for your document titled "Breast Cancer Data Analysis." Follow these instructions:

1. Set the title of the document to "Breast Cancer Data Analysis."
2. Specify the author as your research team's name.
3. Use the bibliography file named "references.bib."
4. Ensure that the document includes the current date.
5. Enable a table of contents for the document.
6. Number the sections in the document.
7. Choose the Pygments highlight style for code.
8. Hide code echo during code execution.
9. For HTML output, enable code folding, code tools, and paged data frame printing.
10. Specify a preference for a visual editor.

Fill in the missing information and structure the YAML front matter according to the provided instructions. Once completed, you'll have a properly configured YAML header for your document, suitable for analysis and presentation.

## Step 2: Insert text and code 
Objective: Integrate the provided text and code into your Quarto document.

Instructions:

1. Incorporate the given text and code snippets into the body of your Quarto document.
2. As you insert key points or emphasize specific terms, utilize Bold, Italic, or any other relevant styles to enhance readability and highlight importance.


**Text**: "Now we read the data, available as a local csv file in the relative path (`breast-cancer-wisconsin/`) below. We use various functions to have a glimpse of its structure and dimensions. We also change the `diagnosis` variable to a factor."

**Code**: 
cancer_data <- as_tibble(read.csv("data/breast-cancer-wisconsin.csv"))
head(cancer_data)
cancer_data$diagnosis <- as.factor(cancer_data$diagnosis)
colnames(cancer_data)
dim(cancer_data)

**Text**
"Echoing the dimensions printed in the output above, this data frame has `r nrow(cancer_data)` rows and `r ncol(cancer_data)` columns. Except for the first two columns, the remaining columns are features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image."

We use the following code to remove columns with missing values (`NA`), and have a glimpse of the remaining columns again.

**Code**
cancer_data <- cancer_data |> select(where(~ all(!is.na(.x))))
head(cancer_data)

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution: Insert text and code (Step 2)</strong></summary>

Now we read the data, available as a local csv file in the relative path (`breast-cancer-wisconsin/`) below. We use various functions to have a glimpse of its structure and dimensions. We also change the `diagnosis` variable to a factor.

```{r read}
cancer_data <- as_tibble(read.csv("data/breast-cancer-wisconsin.csv"))
head(cancer_data)
cancer_data$diagnosis <- as.factor(cancer_data$diagnosis)
colnames(cancer_data)
dim(cancer_data)
```
Echoing the dimensions printed in the output above, this data frame has `r nrow(cancer_data)` rows and `r ncol(cancer_data)` columns. Except for the first two columns, the remaining columns are features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

We use the following code to remove columns with missing values (`NA`), and have a glimpse of the remaining columns again.
```{r remove_na}
cancer_data <- cancer_data |> select(where(~ all(!is.na(.x))))
head(cancer_data)
```

## Step 3: Visualizations in Quarto documents 
TEXT OF THE EXCERCISE

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution: Insert text and code (Step 2)</strong></summary>
  
## Basic summaries
Using the column `diagnosis` in the data, we count that there are `r sum(cancer_data$diagnosis == "M")` Malignant tumours and `r sum(cancer_data$diagnosis == "B")` Benign tumours. We can also plot these counts:
```{r plot-counts, fig.cap = "Counts of data according to tumour status", fig.align = "center", out.width = "70%", fig.asp = 0.65, message = FALSE}
plot_count(cancer_data)
```

# Visualisations and tests of three features
To understand the data better, it is useful to look at, for each tumour status, the distribution of individual features / variables. As an illustration, we shall look at three of them.

## Histogram & density
We first visualise such distributions using histograms and density plots in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-hist). As the same kind of plot is required, a function is written for convenience.

```{r plot-hist, fig.show = "hold", fig.cap = "Histogram and density of three features according to tumour status", fig.align = "center", out.width = "70%", fig.asp = 0.65, message = FALSE}
plot_hist_den(
  cancer_data, var = area_worst, label = "Area worst", filename = "hist_area.png"
)
plot_hist_den(
  cancer_data, var = fractal_dimension_mean, label = "Fractal dimension mean",
  filename = "hist_frac.png"
)
plot_hist_den(
  cancer_data, var = radius_se, label = "Radius se", filename = "hist_radius.png"
)
```

## Boxplots
Another way of visualising the distribution of the three variables above, grouped by the tumuor status, is the box plots in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-boxplot):

```{r plot-boxplot, fig.cap = "Boxplot of three features according to tumour status", fig.show = "hold", fig.pos = "!h", fig.align = "center", out.width = "70%", fig.asp = 0.65, message = FALSE}
plot_boxplot(
  cancer_data, var = area_worst, label = "Area worst", filename = "boxplot_area.png"
)
plot_boxplot(
  cancer_data, var = fractal_dimension_mean, label = "Fractal dimension mean",
  filename = "boxplot_frac.png"
)
plot_boxplot(
  cancer_data, var = radius_se, label = "Radius se", filename = "boxplot_radius.png"
)
```
</details>

## Step 4: Reporting tables 

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution: Insert text and code (Step 2)</strong></summary>

Statistical tests

We can perform two-sample *t*-test to find out if there is a significant difference in the distribution of a feature according to the tumour status.
```{r ttest, results = "hold"}
area_worst_B <- cancer_data$area_worst[cancer_data$diagnosis == "B"]
area_worst_M <- cancer_data$area_worst[cancer_data$diagnosis == "M"]
ttest0 <- t.test(area_worst_B, area_worst_M, var.equal = TRUE)
options(scipen = 3, digits = 3)
```

The $t$-statistic is `r ttest0$statistic` and the $p$-value is `r ttest0$p.value`. We can write a function to carry out the test more systematically:
```{r ttest_functional}
ttest1 <- ttest_var(cancer_data, var = area_worst)
ttest2 <- ttest_var(cancer_data, var = fractal_dimension_mean)
ttest3 <- ttest_var(cancer_data, var = radius_se)
```

The results are in the following table:

| Variable | $t$-statistic | $p$-value |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
|Area worst|`r ttest1$statistic`| `r ttest1$p.value`|
|Fractal dimension mean|`r ttest2$statistic`| `r ttest2$p.value`|
|Radius se|`r ttest3$statistic`| `r ttest3$p.value`|
