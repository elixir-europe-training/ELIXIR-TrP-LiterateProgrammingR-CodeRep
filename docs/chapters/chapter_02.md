## Introduction
This chapter is a gentle introduction to the literate programming approach, and a preview of the components that will be covered in the next few chapters.

## How did you organise your scripts and files? What was your workflow?
Separate scripts and .text files

## I wish there's a way of putting them together
There is!

### Plain script vs a literate programming script

## I'm confused with all these terms
Don't worry, we've got you covered

- RStudio: primarily Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R, but growing support for other languages (Julia, Python)
- Markdown: as a testament, these materials are written in Markdown
- Rmarkdown: essentially R + Markdown, generating results dynamically, thus guaranteeing reproducibility
- YAML: the definition is not very useful; essentially a preamble; similar to lines before `\begin{document}` in a .tex file
- Quarto: the next version of Rmarkdown i.e. R/Python/Julia etc. + Markdown
