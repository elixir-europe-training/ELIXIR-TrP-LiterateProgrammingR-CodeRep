## 5.1 Putting it all together

Now that you have been introduced to:

1. The importance of literate programming (LP)
2. Using markdown to narrate your code
3. Using Quarto to knit your code and narrative into a single LP document


It is time to back to our original script (#81: do we need to introduce this earlier?) and rework it into a full fledged literate programming document by applying our knowledge of markdown and quarto
to transform the original script into an LP HTML or PDF document (Fig. 5.1).

To complete this rounding off activity, you need to:  
1. Obtain the [Wisconsin.R](https://github.com/clement-lee/coderep/blob/master/wisconsin.R) script, copy the script into a new empty script in your RStudio environment
2. Convert the script into a .Qmd or .Rmd document, complete with explanatory narrative and appropriate code chunks for plain code and plots
3. Knit your final .Qmd or .Rmd file to a PDF (or HTML) document and marvel and your wonderful LP-ified verison os the Wisconsin.R script 

There are no right or wrong answers here but certain solutions will definitely be better than others. if you get stuck or need inspiration check out one possible solution [here](https://github.com/clement-lee/coderep/blob/master/wisconsin.Rmd)
